\description{
This function downloads data from the *HEMA Ratings* website and extracts detailed information
about historical European martial arts clubs, including their locations, member counts, and parent organizations.
}
\details{
This function scrapes the HEMA Ratings clubs page and compiles a list of all clubs with relevant metadata.
It identifies parent-child club relationships and merges them with additional club details such as state,
city, and number of members. If the `raw` parameter is set to `FALSE`, the function normalizes names,
countries, and states to ensure consistency.
}
\note{
The function assumes the structure of the HEMA Ratings webpage remains consistent. If the webpage layout changes,
this function may need adjustments.
