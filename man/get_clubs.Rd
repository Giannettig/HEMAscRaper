\description{
This function downloads data from the *HEMA Ratings* website and extracts detailed information
about historical European martial arts clubs, including their locations, member counts, and parent organizations.
}
\details{
This function scrapes the HEMA Ratings clubs page and compiles a list of all clubs with relevant metadata.
It identifies parent-child club relationships and merges them with additional club details such as state,
city, and number of members.

The function assumes the structure of the HEMA Ratings webpage remains consistent. If the webpage layout changes,
this function may need adjustments.
}
\note{
The function uses `rvest` for web scraping and `dplyr` for data manipulation. It handles potential parent-child relationships between clubs.
