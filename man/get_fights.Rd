\description{
This function downloads data from the *HEMA Ratings* website and extracts detailed fight statistics
for events that occurred within a specified year or set of years. If no year is specified, the function
gathers fight data for all available events.
}
\details{
This function scrapes the HEMA Ratings events page and compiles a list of all fights for the specified years.
If no `year` is provided, it extracts fight data for all events available on the website. For each event, it calls
the `get_tournament()` function to gather detailed fight-level information.
}
\note{
The function uses `rvest` for HTML parsing and `purrr` for handling multiple event pages. It performs basic error handling
to check if events matching the specified years are available. Depending on the number of events and the size of the tournament data,
the function may take some time to run.
}

\dontrun{
# Download all HEMA fight data for the year 2022

# Download HEMA fight data for multiple years (e.g., 2019 and 2020)
fights_2019_2020 <- get_fights(c(2019, 2020))

# Download HEMA fight data for all available years
all_fights <- get_fights()
