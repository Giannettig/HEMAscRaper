This function downloads data from the *HEMA Ratings* website and extracts detailed information
about historical European martial arts fighters, including their names, nationalities, and associated clubs.
}
\details{
This function scrapes the HEMA Ratings website, specifically the fighters table, and extracts
relevant details for each fighter. It uses the `rvest` and `dplyr` packages to parse the HTML structure and
organize the extracted information into a tibble.
}

The function assumes the structure of the HEMA Ratings webpage remains consistent. If the webpage layout changes,
this function may break.
